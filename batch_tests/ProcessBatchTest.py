"""
Script to analyze the difference between two BatchTest-*.py output files.
"""

helpmsg="""
Usage:
    -a <file>       The baseline test output (e.g. not batched case)
    -b <file>       The test output which needs to be compared to the baseline

    --nfs           If set, the performacen will be measured based on the peak 
                    mapped NF count of both test outputs. Otherwise only the 
                    test level is considered.

    Outputs a sequence of percentages measuring how much test B improved 
    the performance throughtout the test.
